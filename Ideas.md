* Add come CADQuery examples
* Investigate [cqMore](https://github.com/JustinSDK/cqMore) as well
* Figure out how to properly run Cura headless. [This](http://ibrieger.de/cura-commandline-wrapper.html) can be useful.
* Figure out if it would be feasible to import STLs for post-edits to CADQuery (instead of OpenSCAD).
  See [this e-mail thread](https://groups.google.com/g/cadquery/c/Gg1PU2duXoA).
* Add script for generating boilerplate OpenSCAD files (including repositioning imported STLs to coordinates origin).
