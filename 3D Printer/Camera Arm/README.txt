## Assembly Instructions and precautions. 

Inserting Swivel Pin READ BELOW!

READ THIS FIRST - Before you insert the Swivel Pin into the boom.. Decide if you are mounting your camera on the top or the bottom.. once you insert the pin it WONT COME OUT!!!

When you are sure you are inserting the pin the require direction. Insert the end with the split first.. get it started.. then use a table or other hard surface to push the pin in the rest of the way.  

Trim out the holes for the M2 bolt just enough so that it threads in firmly. You don't want it too loose or too tight.. too tight and you will split the plastic hinge.

If your going to use the No_Bolt Pin option only trim enough so that the pin squeezes in between the cam case hinges. You want it very tight so friction holds the cams position.

To mount the boom to the X stepper cover. Look at the images. It clips on very easy. Then  lock it in place with a clip.
